webserver.py is run on localhost on port 6789, where after running the program, you can simply ask for the HelloWorld.html file through the web browser (http://localhost:6789/HelloWorld.html)

proxyserver.py is run on localhost on port 8888, where you can simply ask for any online webpages by using the following format: (http://localhost:8888/www.google.com), where you can replace google.com with other websites. Some other websites that have worked for me are Youtube.com, agar.io, Amazon.com.
